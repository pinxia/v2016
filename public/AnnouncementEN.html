          <h3 class="text-center"> SCCS Online Registration Available August 3rd</h3>
           <p class="text-center"><a href="AnnouncementCH.php">(中文版)</a></p>
            <p><strong>  Dear SCCS Members,</strong>
              <p>I hope you and your family are having an enjoyable, safe and 
                productive summer. As we’re wrapping up the month of July and getting 
                ready for an exciting new school year, I’d like to share with you some 
                recent development of our school: </p>
                <p>
                <strong>First of all</strong>, the 2014-2015 academic year calendar has been posted on 
                our website (under “School Calendar”).<strong> Our school will start on 
                Sunday, September 7th, 2014.</strong> The enrichment program (i.e. non-Chinese 
                Language classes) will begin a week later on<strong> September 14th, 2014 </strong>. The 
                school door will be open at 12:30 P.M. for on-site registration and 
                <strong>the first class will start at 1:20 P.M </strong>. You will find the dates for 
                school meetings throughout the entire school year on our website. So 
                please mark your calendar accordingly. </p>

                <p>After a lot of hard work from our staff during the summer, the online 
                registration for the fall semester will be available to our members 
                this Sunday, August 3rd. Please log in using this link: 
                <a href=" http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/MemberAccount/MemberLoginForm.php">Member Log In</a>.
                If you forget your log-in ID and/or password, you can either click on 
                the retrieve link on the log-in page or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org">
                support@ynhchineseschool.org </a>. If your family does not have an online 
                account, please click register on the log-in page to register a 
                parent to the school, then add in other family members once the 
                parent’s account is approved. Once you complete <strong>online registration</strong>, 
                please remember to <strong>mail your payment (check only)</strong> with the payment 
                voucher to the following address: </p>
                <address><strong>Southern Connecticut Chinese School<br>
                  P.O. Box 8296<br>
                           New Haven, CT 06530<br></strong>
                </address>
                <p><strong> I highly encourage you to register as soon as possible</strong> since spaces 
                are very limited for some of our classes. You will also enjoy a 50% 
                off registration fee discount if you register AND make payment by 
                September 1st. </p>

               <p> Please note that we have made an important change to the registration 
                process for the heritage students. In order to give parents and 
                students more flexibility and greater choice, we no longer assign the 
                returning heritage student to a particular Chinese Language class as 
                we did in previous years; instead, we offer the parents and students a 
                chance to sign up a Chinese class that best suits their needs. For the 
                1st to 6th Grade heritage students, we offer two types of Chinese 
                class: regular and intensive classes. The intensive class uses the 
                same textbook as the regular class, but it would have more homework 
                and requires more parental involvement and support; and, as a result, 
                might be more effective in improving the student’s Chinese 
                proficiency. Depending on your child’s current Chinese level, 
                motivation, expectation, and other factors, you may choose either 
                regular or intensive Chinese class for your child. Once again, I’d 
                like to point out that the purpose for this new policy is to offer our 
                parents a greater freedom in choosing a suitable class for their 
                children. We hope that greater family choice will lead to more 
                effective and productive learning experience.  
                </p>
                
               <p><strong>Secondly, we are very pleased to announce that our school has hired a 
                campus police officer</strong> to be in charge of school safety during the 
                2014-2015 academic year. This new development is the result of efforts 
                made by the school Board and administrative team, in collaboration 
                with the Southern Connecticut State University Police Department. Our 
                school is committed to providing a safe and healthy learning 
                environment for our students and teachers. Throughout the fall 
                semester, we will also set up fire drill, public safety presentations, 
                and other safety related events. We hope that the on-site police 
                officer, with the assistance of a group of devoted parent volunteers, 
                will make our school a safer and more enjoyable place for our 
                children. Since the patrol deposit is no longer mandatory, a $40 
                patrol fee will be credited back to your account if you have 
                successfully fulfilled your patrol duty last year. </p>

               <p><strong> Last but not least</strong>, a friendly reminder that our school summer camp 
                will be held from August 11 to 22. If you are still interested in 
                signing up, please download and fill in the camp application form from 
                our school homepage:<a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/public/main.php"> http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/</a>
               </p>
               <p> Thank you for your continued support to our school. My colleagues and 
                I are excited to work with you and spend another happy and successful 
                school year together. <p> 
              <p>  Look forward to seeing you all in September!</p>
              <p>  Warm Regards,<br>
                Henan Cheng <br>
