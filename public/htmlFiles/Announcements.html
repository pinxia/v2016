                <p class="text-center"> (SCCS Online Registration Available August 3rd)</p>
                <p><strong>  Dear SCCS Members,</strong>
                <p>I hope you and your family are having an enjoyable, safe and 
                    productive summer. As we’re wrapping up the month of July and getting 
                    ready for an exciting new school year, I’d like to share with you some 
                    recent development of our school: </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>First of all</strong>, the 2014-2015 academic year calendar has been posted on 
                    our website (under “School Calendar”).<strong> Our school will start on 
                        Sunday, September 7th, 2014.</strong> The enrichment program (i.e. non-Chinese 
                    Language classes) will begin a week later on<strong> September 14th, 2014 </strong>. The 
                    school door will be open at 12:30 P.M. for on-site registration and 
                    <strong>the first class will start at 1:20 P.M </strong>. You will find the dates for 
                    school meetings throughout the entire school year on our website. So 
                    please mark your calendar accordingly. </p>

                <p>After a lot of hard work from our staff during the summer, the online 
                    registration for the fall semester will be available to our members 
                    this Sunday, August 3rd. Please log in using this link: 
                    <a href=" http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/MemberAccount/MemberLoginForm.php">Member Log In</a>.
                    If you forget your log-in ID and/or password, you can either click on 
                    the retrieve link on the log-in page or send an email to <a href="mailto: support@ynhchineseschool.org">
                        support@ynhchineseschool.org </a>. If your family does not have an online 
                    account, please click register on the log-in page to register a 
                    parent to the school, then add in other family members once the 
                    parent’s account is approved. Once you complete <strong>online registration</strong>, 
                    please remember to <strong>mail your payment (check only)</strong> with the payment 
                    voucher to the following address: </p>
                <address><strong>Southern Connecticut Chinese School<br>
                        P.O. Box 2097<br>
                        74 Washington Ave<br>
                        North Haven, CT 06473<br></strong>
                </address>
                <p><strong> I highly encourage you to register as soon as possible</strong> since spaces 
                    are very limited for some of our classes. You will also enjoy a 50% 
                    off registration fee discount if you register AND make payment by 
                    September 1st. </p>

                <p> Please note that we have made an important change to the registration 
                    process for the heritage students. In order to give parents and 
                    students more flexibility and greater choice, we no longer assign the 
                    returning heritage student to a particular Chinese Language class as 
                    we did in previous years; instead, we offer the parents and students a 
                    chance to sign up a Chinese class that best suits their needs. For the 
                    1st to 6th Grade heritage students, we offer two types of Chinese 
                    class: regular and intensive classes. The intensive class uses the 
                    same textbook as the regular class, but it would have more homework 
                    and requires more parental involvement and support; and, as a result, 
                    might be more effective in improving the student’s Chinese 
                    proficiency. Depending on your child’s current Chinese level, 
                    motivation, expectation, and other factors, you may choose either 
                    regular or intensive Chinese class for your child. Once again, I’d 
                    like to point out that the purpose for this new policy is to offer our 
                    parents a greater freedom in choosing a suitable class for their 
                    children. We hope that greater family choice will lead to more 
                    effective and productive learning experience.  
                </p>

                <p><strong>Secondly, we are very pleased to announce that our school has hired a 
                        campus police officer</strong> to be in charge of school safety during the 
                    2014-2015 academic year. This new development is the result of efforts 
                    made by the school Board and administrative team, in collaboration 
                    with the Southern Connecticut State University Police Department. Our 
                    school is committed to providing a safe and healthy learning 
                    environment for our students and teachers. Throughout the fall 
                    semester, we will also set up fire drill, public safety presentations, 
                    and other safety related events. We hope that the on-site police 
                    officer, with the assistance of a group of devoted parent volunteers, 
                    will make our school a safer and more enjoyable place for our 
                    children. Since the patrol deposit is no longer mandatory, a $40 
                    patrol fee will be credited back to your account if you have 
                    successfully fulfilled your patrol duty last year. </p>

                <p><strong> Last but not least</strong>, a friendly reminder that our school summer camp 
                    will be held from August 11 to 22. If you are still interested in 
                    signing up, please download and fill in the camp application form from 
                    our school homepage:<a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/public/main.php"> http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/</a>
                </p>
                <p> Thank you for your continued support to our school. My colleagues and 
                    I are excited to work with you and spend another happy and successful 
                    school year together. <p> 
                <p>  Look forward to seeing you all in September!</p>
                <p>  Warm Regards,<br>

                <p><strong>  亲爱的南康中文学校家长，老师，和同学们，</strong></p>
                <p>您们好！</p>
                <p>希望大家正在渡过一个轻松愉快，安全健康的暑假。今天是七月的最后一天，不知不觉假期已经过去了一大半，转眼又到了准备新学期的时候了。我想要在此向大家简要报告一下南康中文学校关于新学期的一些最新的进展。</p>

                <p>首先，我们想要通知大家2014-2015学年的日历已经在学校的网站上登出。学校将于九月七号开学（中文课开课）， 文化课将于之后一周的九月十四号开课。经过办公室工作人员在暑假期间的积极努力，我校网上注册将于本周日八月三号正式开始， 请点击以下链接进行注册：
                    <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/MemberAccount/MemberLoginForm.php">Member Log In</a></p>

                <p><strong>如果您是新会员</strong>，请先在网上开设帐户，然后再按照提示的步骤完成课程的注册。若您在注册过程中遇到了麻烦，请及时与我们的IT工作人员联系，他们的电子邮箱是:<a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org "> support@ynhchineseschool.org</a>. 您完成网上注册之后，请将支票连同注册清单一起寄到如下地址：</p>
                <address><strong>Southern Connecticut Chinese School<br>
                        P.O. Box 2097<br>
                        74 Washington Ave<br>
                        North Haven, CT 06473</strong>
                </address>

                <p>由于有些课程人数有严格的限制，请您抓紧时间尽快注册。对于在九月一日之前注册并付费的家庭，我校将给予注册费减半的优惠。</p>

                <p><strong>对于华裔班中文课的注册，学校进行了一些与往年不同的调整</strong>。 为了更好地让家长和同学们掌握主动性，我们今年不再提前指派班级，而是让家长和同学们自愿选择班级。<br>对于一年级到六年级的华裔班同学，考虑到不同的需求，我们设置了两种类型的班级供大家选择：普通班和强化班。<br>这两类班级采用同样的教材，不同之处在于：强化班作业量稍大，也需要家长更多参与和督促，当然孩子的中文也会进步更快。您可以根据孩子的具体情况加以选择。
                    <br>我们希望新的做法能够给予家长和孩子更多的主动性和灵活性，以便更有效地调动孩子学习的积极性，提高学习效果。</p>

                <p>其次，我们很高兴地通知大家，我校从今年秋季开始将雇佣南康州立大学的校警在我校教学楼内值班巡逻。确保为全体师生提供一个安全的学习环境一直是我们工作的重点。在过去的一年中，学校理事会和办公室人员积极与南康联系协商。在大家的共同努力之下，我们终于可以在新的学年里将这个长期以来的想法变成现实。对于在上一学年已经按规定履行了安全巡逻职责的家长，我们将会返还$40押金到您的帐户上。在新的学年里，我们将不再要求缴纳押金，但是我们仍然需要热心的家长们积极参与学校的安全工作，协助校警将我们的学校变得更有序，更安全。
                </p>
                <p>最后，还要提醒大家的是中文学校的夏令营将于八月十一日到二十二日在New Haven举办。感兴趣的家长现在仍可以报名。<br>夏令营的报名表和详细介绍请见中文学校主页：

                <p>再一次感谢各位成员对南康中文学校的大力支持。中文学校的全体教职员工期待与您及您的孩子共同渡过一个充实愉快的新学期！</p>
                <p>祝夏安！</p>

                    <p>今年，我校有幸招募到数名有爱心，积极认真，富有经验的教师加入到我们的队伍中来。我们非常期待与这些教师们合作。下面是部分新教师的简介：</p>

                    <b>Course Description:</b><br>
                    <p>Pinyin plays a very important role in Chinese language learning. It helps students pronounce correctly, and memorize the characters. The Chinese pinyin class is designed for students who are interested in improving their pinyin. We strongly encourage students Grade 2 and up who are struggling with pinyin to sign up the class.</p>
                    <p><b>为什么要学好拼音?</b><br>
                        学好拼音是为了学会正确的发音,而正确的发音是中文学习的重要组成部分,对理解、记忆中文有很大的帮助. 同时, 在电子时代, 学好拼音,才能把中文变成电子文本, 快速地交流传递. 为了帮助低年级同学加强、巩固学过的拼音,中文学校计划在 2014年秋季增开拼音强化班,
                        欢迎 1年级以上的同学报名参加,课程将以强化拼音的听说读写练习为主. </p>

            <p class="text-danger">Please note that the final list of the enrichment programs is subject to change. We will have to cancel the class if the number of registered students is less than 8. Please let us know if you have any questions on these courses. </p>
            <p>Have a wonderful weekend! </p>

                <p class="lead"><strong>亲爱的南康中文学校全体成员,</strong></p>
                <p>值此金秋的第一天，先祝大家秋安！</p>

                <p>中文学校已经开学三周了，我们希望您和您的孩子已经适应了新学期。在这里我想简要预告一下中文学校近期内的一些活动:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p> 首先，想要提醒大家的是本学期取消课程注册的最后期限已过。如果你取消课程，学校将不再会退还学费。</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>  学校小卖部开业 (<b>时间：9月28日，地点: B Wing一楼小餐厅</b>) 请老师和家长告知同学们本周日前来小餐厅用他们辛勤学习积攒的点数来换取小奖品。</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>学生展示活动:“我的夏日足迹”</b></p>
                        <p>为了提高我们学生的中文学习兴趣和综合能力，中文学校计划在本学年展开一系列的课堂外活动。感谢家长们的建议，尤其是理事会副理事长刘岩斌女士的热心支持，我们即将开展的一个活动是“我的夏日足迹”。相信在刚刚过去的这个暑期，孩子们的足迹留在了这个世界的很多地方。无论是远方的故国，还是现在的家园，我们希望孩子们能和他们在中文学校的朋友们分享那些新鲜的感受和欢颜笑语。</p>

                        <br><p>活动的内容形式如下: 感兴趣参加的同学们请于本周日（09/28）向各班老师报名，然后准备一个可以摆放的展示板（poster），并且准备在展示时的介绍，讨论和回答问题。学校将从10/05号开始在Cafeteria按年级安排展示。展示日12：45可以开始布置展示。展示日课间休息时间将有所调整，由3：00-3：10延长到3：00-3：20，届时展示学生需要守在自己展板前用中文进行交流。</p>

                        <p>相信很多家长和高年级学生对这个活动模式（poster session）不陌生。中文学校在提供高质量的中文教育之外，力图提供孩子们需要的素质教育。这个努力体现在了课表里新增的阅读写作演讲课程里，也将体现在这些生动有趣的课堂外的活动里。</p><br>
                    </li> 
                    <li><b> 学校网页更新</b> 我们最近在学校网站的“校友”栏内增加了两篇中文学校校友张停云的近作。文章请详见以下链接：
                        <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php">SCCS Alumini</a>
                        停云去年作为国际公益教育组织“美丽中国”的教师在云南的乡村学校支教一年。我们相信她的感人故事会给许多中文学校的同学们带来很多思考和启示。如果您愿意分享类似的有教育意义的校友事迹，请随时同我们联系。
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>最后，我们想再一次强调中文学校属于每一位同学，老师和家长，不仅仅在理念上，也在法律上。为了孩子们更好的教育和成长，中文学校欢迎和期待每一位会员的热心参与和支持。您可以选择参加学校的各种事务委员会或者以一名志愿者的方式来参与。我们真诚的希望大家能够从我做起！从今天开始！
                    <br><br>
                    再次感谢大家对中文学校的信任与支持!</p>

                祝好!<br>

                <p class="lead"><strong>  Dear SCCS Members,</strong>
                <p> Happy first day of autumn! Hope you enjoy this gorgeous autumn weather.</p>
                <p>As our school has been back in session for three weeks now, different activities are in full swing. Here I would like to give you a heads up on some upcoming events and activities at the SCCS in the next couple of weeks: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>  Deadline for dropping class passed.</b> Just a friendly reminder that the class shopping period has passed; therefore, no refund will be issued if you drop a class.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b>  School store open this Sunday.</b> Our school store will be open for the first time this semester on Sunday, September 28. Please share this exciting news with your child so that they can redeem their hard-earned tokens for some nice prizes.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>  “My Summer Footprints” poster session on October 5.</b> Thanks to the wonderful ideas of our parents (especially Ms. Yanbin Liu, the Vice Chair of the Board), we plan to organize a student poster session with the theme of family summer travels. During this past summer, our children's footprints have been left all over the world. Whether it is an adventure to distant lands, or a fun trip to local attractions, we would like to encourage our students to share their stories with their friends at the SCCS. The students who are interested in participating in this event should inform their teachers by this Sunday, September 28. The participants are expected to prepare a poster presentation in Chinese (or at least a hybrid of Chinese and English), and have a discussion and Q/A with their peers and families.</li>

                    <li>The poster session will take place in the Cafeteria in B Wing from 12:45 to 5:00 P.M. on October 5. On the day of event, the presenters should set up their posters before class at 12:45pm. They can present when they are not taking class. The recess time of that day will be rearranged to accommodate the event: the recess between the 2nd and 3rd periods will be extended to 20 minutes (from 3: 00-3: 20 P.M.).

                    <li>This event is the first of a series of educational events we plan to host during the new school year. As an educator, I firmly believe that these informal, hands-on and fun activities will greatly increase students’ interests in learning Chinese and improve their practical language skills. In addition to providing high quality Chinese language education, the SCCS seeks to provide all-around education to our student as well. This effort is not only reflected in the new courses such as reading, writing, and public speaking, but also in educational activities outside of the classroom. </li>

                    <li><b>  Updates on school website.</b> We recently update our school website by posting two touching essays by Linda Zhang, a SCCS alumna, who taught as “Teach for China” fellow in a rural school in Yunnan Province last year. Please check the following link for more details:
                        <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php">http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php</a>
                        If you have any inspiring stories to share, please contact us. We also would like to encourage parents and teachers to contribute articles, photos, and useful resources to the Community page of our website.   
                    </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, we can’t stress enough that the SCCS belongs to every student, parent and teacher, not only in ideas, but also by the law. Our school has been benefited tremendously from the collective wisdom and talents of our members. In order to give our children a better education and a more promising future, we call for active participation of our parents in school activities. Please consider to make your contribution by serving on different school Committees or simply by signing up as a volunteer! Please take action now!
                </p>
                Thank you for your support!

            <p class="text-center"><a href="#20141212En">English Version</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#20141212Ch">Chinese Version</a></p>
            <article class="container" id="20141212En">
                <p class="lead">Dear SCCS Students, Teachers, and Parents,</p>

                <p>Another exciting semester has flown by. This Sunday, December 14, is the last day of school for the fall 2014 semester. We hope that you and your child have had a wonderful experience at our school. We are grateful for the opportunity to serve your child.</p>

                <p>To ensure everything running smoothly on the last day of school, I would like to draw you attention on a few important things:</p>

                <p><b>§  First,</b> the School is organizing an end-of-semester talent show from 12:30 to 1:40 P.M. in Room C112 to celebrate the achievement of our students. In order to accommodate this event, all classes will start 20 min later than the regular class schedule. As a result, the whole class period will run from 1:40 to 5:10 P.M. instead of 1:20 to 4:50 P.M. this Sunday. More details about the talent show will be sent out shortly by the PTA.</p>

                <p><b>§  Second,</b> please remember to return the teaching evaluation forms to the school office located in Room A105. If, for some reason, you haven’t received the evaluation form, please download the attached electronic copy. Your feedback and suggestions are crucial to improve our teaching quality. We would greatly appreciate if you can take a couple of minutes to complete the form.</p>

                <p><b>§  The school store will be open this Sunday.</b> Please remind your child to come to the cafeteria to redeem prizes. Please note that there is an important change of policy: gift cards are no longer available at the store. Students must come to the office to redeem gift cards. Students can get gift cards throughout the semester whenever the office is open. Please inform your child about this important change.</p>

                <p><b>§  Last but not least,</b> a quick reminder that the spring 2015 semester will start on Sunday, January 18 (Chinese classes start on that day and enrichment classes start one week later). All school dates can be found in “School Calendar” on our website. If you haven’t registered for the spring semester, please contact our IT managers at: <a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org">support@ynhchineseschool.org</a>  They will help you register classes or make adjustment.</p>

                <p>Once again, thank you very much for such a wonderful semester at the SCCS. My colleagues and I really enjoyed working with you all. It is truly rewarding.</p>

                <p>Best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a New Year filled with Peace and Happiness!</p>
                <p>Cordially,</p>

               <h3 class="text-center">南康中文学校2014秋季期末通知</h3>
                <p class="lead"> 尊敬的南康中文学校学生，家长和老师：</p>
                <p>你们好！</p>
                <p>时光飞逝，转眼之间难忘的2014年就要结束了。我谨代表中文学校全体老师和工作人员感谢大家在过去的一年里对中文学校的大力支持。我希望您和您的孩子在中文学校渡过了愉快，有意义的一年。

                <p>这个周日（12月14日）是中文学校在2014年的最后一天，在此有几件重要的事情需要提醒大家：

                <p><b>§  首先，</b>中文学校将于下午12点半至1点40分在C112小礼堂举办名为“欢歌诗语”的学生才艺表演。为了鼓励各年级的同学们的积极参与，学校特意将这个星期的所有课程顺延20分钟。第一节课将于1点40分开始上课，最后一节课将于5点10分下课。学校PTA稍后将会发出关于才艺表演的详细信息。
                </p>
                <p><b>§  其次，</b>请各位家长将上周发给您的孩子的教学评估表于本周日交到A105 房间学校办公室。如果您尚未收到评估表，请下载附件中的表格。您的反馈和建议将会极大地帮助我们提高教学质量。
                </p>
                <p><b>§  此外，</b>本周学校小卖部开门，请老师和家长提醒同学们兑换奖品。近期学校关于兑换礼品券(gift cards)的规定作出重要调整。从本周开始，小卖部将不再兑换礼品券，所有需要兑换礼品券的同学们请到学校办公室办理。今后，同学们可以每个星期来办公室兑换礼品券，而不必像从前那样必须等到小卖部开门。请家长和老师及时告知同学们这一重要的变化。
                </p>
                <p><b>§  最后还需要提醒大家的是,</b>下学期将于1月18号开学（中文课当日上课，文化课一周后上课）。春季的所有上课时间均已列在学校网站的“校历”上，请留意察看。对于需要注册或调整春季课程的家长，请于寒假期间与学校的IT 人员联系：support@ynhchineseschool.org</p>

                    <p>最后，再一次感谢您的信任与支持！祝您和家人新年快乐，健康幸福！ </p>
