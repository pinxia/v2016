                        The 6th Southern Connecticut Chinese School Summer Camp completed successfully when the campers gave a wonderful performance on Friday, August 22, at the New Haven Public Library. Within the short two weeks, students learned Chinese, Math, Science and Computer Programming. They also participated into various culture activities, such as making lantern, papercut and origami, practicing calligraphy and painting, visiting Yale Art Gallery, having a tour of Yale campus, and participating in exciting reading and science programs at the New Haven Public Library. Students were so happy that they improved greatly their Chinese, deepened their knowledge of Chinese culture and increased their interests in learning Chinese in this relaxing and joyful atmosphere.
