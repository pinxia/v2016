                <p>Pinyin plays a very important role in Chinese language learning. It helps students pronounce correctly, and memorize the characters. The Chinese pinyin class is designed for students who are interested in improving their pinyin. We strongly encourage students Grade 2 and up who are struggling with pinyin to sign up the class.</p>
                <p><b>为什么要学好拼音?</b><br>
                    学好拼音是为了学会正确的发音,而正确的发音是中文学习的重要组成部分,对理解、记忆中文有很大的帮助. 同时, 在电子时代, 学好拼音,才能把中文变成电子文本, 快速地交流传递. 为了帮助低年级同学加强、巩固学过的拼音,中文学校计划在 2014年秋季增开拼音强化班,
                    欢迎 1年级以上的同学报名参加,课程将以强化拼音的听说读写练习为主. </p>
