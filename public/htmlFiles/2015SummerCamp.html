                    Hi, Chinese Summer Camp Families:<br />
                    The teachers and counselors have enjoyed spending time with the campers during classes, lunch, and culture activity time. We had a lot of fun celebrating holidays everyday!&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="assets/pdf/2015CampWeek1.pdf" target="blank">Go to the whole story...</a>

                    <br />  As the two-week long camp drew to a close, we would like to thank you for your trust and support! It is truly our honor to spend quality time with your child as we explore the wonder of Chinese culture. <br /><a target="blank" href="assets/pdf/2015CampWeek2.pdf">Go to the whole story...</a>
