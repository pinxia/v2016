                <p><strong>  Dear SCCS Members,</strong></p>
                <p>I hope you and your family are having an enjoyable, safe and 
                    productive summer. As we’re wrapping up the month of July and getting 
                    ready for an exciting new school year, I’d like to share with you some 
                    recent development of our school: </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>First of all</strong>, the 2014-2015 academic year calendar has been posted on 
                    our website (under “School Calendar”).<strong> Our school will start on 
                        Sunday, September 7th, 2014.</strong> The enrichment program (i.e. non-Chinese 
                    Language classes) will begin a week later on<strong> September 14th, 2014 </strong>. The 
                    school door will be open at 12:30 P.M. for on-site registration and 
                    <strong>the first class will start at 1:20 P.M </strong>. You will find the dates for 
                    school meetings throughout the entire school year on our website. So 
                    please mark your calendar accordingly. </p>

                <p>After a lot of hard work from our staff during the summer, the online 
                    registration for the fall semester will be available to our members 
                    this Sunday, August 3rd. Please log in using this link: 
                    <a href=" http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/MemberAccount/MemberLoginForm.php">Member Log In</a>.
                    If you forget your log-in ID and/or password, you can either click on 
                    the retrieve link on the log-in page or send an email to <a href="mailto: support@ynhchineseschool.org">
                        support@ynhchineseschool.org </a>. If your family does not have an online 
                    account, please click register on the log-in page to register a 
                    parent to the school, then add in other family members once the 
                    parent’s account is approved. Once you complete <strong>online registration</strong>, 
                    please remember to <strong>mail your payment (check only)</strong> with the payment 
                    voucher to the following address: </p>
                <address><strong>Southern Connecticut Chinese School<br>
                        P.O. Box 2097<br>
                        74 Washington Ave<br>
                        North Haven, CT 06473<br></strong>
                </address>
                <p><strong> I highly encourage you to register as soon as possible</strong> since spaces 
                    are very limited for some of our classes. You will also enjoy a 50% 
                    off registration fee discount if you register AND make payment by 
                    September 1st. </p>

                <p> Please note that we have made an important change to the registration 
                    process for the heritage students. In order to give parents and 
                    students more flexibility and greater choice, we no longer assign the 
                    returning heritage student to a particular Chinese Language class as 
                    we did in previous years; instead, we offer the parents and students a 
                    chance to sign up a Chinese class that best suits their needs. For the 
                    1st to 6th Grade heritage students, we offer two types of Chinese 
                    class: regular and intensive classes. The intensive class uses the 
                    same textbook as the regular class, but it would have more homework 
                    and requires more parental involvement and support; and, as a result, 
                    might be more effective in improving the student’s Chinese 
                    proficiency. Depending on your child’s current Chinese level, 
                    motivation, expectation, and other factors, you may choose either 
                    regular or intensive Chinese class for your child. Once again, I’d 
                    like to point out that the purpose for this new policy is to offer our 
                    parents a greater freedom in choosing a suitable class for their 
                    children. We hope that greater family choice will lead to more 
                    effective and productive learning experience.  
                </p>

                <p><strong>Secondly, we are very pleased to announce that our school has hired a 
                        campus police officer</strong> to be in charge of school safety during the 
                    2014-2015 academic year. This new development is the result of efforts 
                    made by the school Board and administrative team, in collaboration 
                    with the Southern Connecticut State University Police Department. Our 
                    school is committed to providing a safe and healthy learning 
                    environment for our students and teachers. Throughout the fall 
                    semester, we will also set up fire drill, public safety presentations, 
                    and other safety related events. We hope that the on-site police 
                    officer, with the assistance of a group of devoted parent volunteers, 
                    will make our school a safer and more enjoyable place for our 
                    children. Since the patrol deposit is no longer mandatory, a $40 
                    patrol fee will be credited back to your account if you have 
                    successfully fulfilled your patrol duty last year. </p>

                <p><strong> Last but not least</strong>, a friendly reminder that our school summer camp 
                    will be held from August 11 to 22. If you are still interested in 
                    signing up, please download and fill in the camp application form from 
                    our school homepage:<a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/public/main.php"> http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/</a>
                </p>
                <p> Thank you for your continued support to our school. My colleagues and 
                    I are excited to work with you and spend another happy and successful 
                    school year together. <p> 
                <p>  Look forward to seeing you all in September!</p>
                <p>  Warm Regards,<br>

                <p><strong>  亲爱的南康中文学校家长，老师，和同学们，</strong></p>
                <p>您们好！</p>
                <p>希望大家正在渡过一个轻松愉快，安全健康的暑假。今天是七月的最后一天，不知不觉假期已经过去了一大半，转眼又到了准备新学期的时候了。我想要在此向大家简要报告一下南康中文学校关于新学期的一些最新的进展。</p>

                <p>首先，我们想要通知大家2014-2015学年的日历已经在学校的网站上登出。学校将于九月七号开学（中文课开课）， 文化课将于之后一周的九月十四号开课。经过办公室工作人员在暑假期间的积极努力，我校网上注册将于本周日八月三号正式开始， 请点击以下链接进行注册：
                    <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v08/MemberAccount/MemberLoginForm.php">Member Log In</a></p>

                <p><strong>如果您是新会员</strong>，请先在网上开设帐户，然后再按照提示的步骤完成课程的注册。若您在注册过程中遇到了麻烦，请及时与我们的IT工作人员联系，他们的电子邮箱是:<a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org "> support@ynhchineseschool.org</a>. 您完成网上注册之后，请将支票连同注册清单一起寄到如下地址：</p>
                <address><strong>Southern Connecticut Chinese School<br>
                        P.O. Box 2097<br>
                        74 Washington Ave<br>
                        North Haven, CT 06473</strong>
                </address>

                <p>由于有些课程人数有严格的限制，请您抓紧时间尽快注册。对于在九月一日之前注册并付费的家庭，我校将给予注册费减半的优惠。</p>

                <p><strong>对于华裔班中文课的注册，学校进行了一些与往年不同的调整</strong>。 为了更好地让家长和同学们掌握主动性，我们今年不再提前指派班级，而是让家长和同学们自愿选择班级。<br>对于一年级到六年级的华裔班同学，考虑到不同的需求，我们设置了两种类型的班级供大家选择：普通班和强化班。<br>这两类班级采用同样的教材，不同之处在于：强化班作业量稍大，也需要家长更多参与和督促，当然孩子的中文也会进步更快。您可以根据孩子的具体情况加以选择。
                    <br>我们希望新的做法能够给予家长和孩子更多的主动性和灵活性，以便更有效地调动孩子学习的积极性，提高学习效果。</p>

                <p>其次，我们很高兴地通知大家，我校从今年秋季开始将雇佣南康州立大学的校警在我校教学楼内值班巡逻。确保为全体师生提供一个安全的学习环境一直是我们工作的重点。在过去的一年中，学校理事会和办公室人员积极与南康联系协商。在大家的共同努力之下，我们终于可以在新的学年里将这个长期以来的想法变成现实。对于在上一学年已经按规定履行了安全巡逻职责的家长，我们将会返还$40押金到您的帐户上。在新的学年里，我们将不再要求缴纳押金，但是我们仍然需要热心的家长们积极参与学校的安全工作，协助校警将我们的学校变得更有序，更安全。
                </p>
                <p>最后，还要提醒大家的是中文学校的夏令营将于八月十一日到二十二日在New Haven举办。感兴趣的家长现在仍可以报名。<br>夏令营的报名表和详细介绍请见中文学校主页：

                <p>再一次感谢各位成员对南康中文学校的大力支持。中文学校的全体教职员工期待与您及您的孩子共同渡过一个充实愉快的新学期！</p>
                <p>祝夏安！</p>

                        <p><strong> Dear Southern Connecticut Chinese School Parents,</strong>
                        <p>Hope the last week of August is going well. Just a friendly reminder that the early registration discount will end in a couple of days. If you would like to take advantage of this special opportunity, please register AND make the payment by Sunday, August 31. We would like to say a big thank-you to those parents who have already registered and paid for the tuition. Your cooperation and support has meant a lot to us. We are confident that our school will be better and stronger during the new school year.</p>
                        <p>This year we have recruited a number of caring, enthusiastic and experienced teachers to join our team. We feel very fortunate to have the privilege to work with these excellent teachers. Below is a brief introduction on some of the new teachers:</p>
                        <p><b>Mrs. Jianhua Shen</b>: Mrs. Shen is a faculty member at the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale University, where she has taught Chinese since 2003.

Throughout the year, we will provide administrative support to our teachers; meanwhile, we will also offer professional development opportunities to the teachers so that they can better serve our students.</p>

                        <p>今年，我校有幸招募到数名有爱心，积极认真，富有经验的教师加入到我们的队伍中来。我们非常期待与这些教师们合作。下面是部分新教师的简介：</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>沈建华老师.</b> 沈老师是耶鲁大学东亚系资深中文教师。她自2003年到现在在耶鲁大学中文部教授中文。之前，沈老师也曾在哈佛大学和北京语言大学教授中文。沈老师本科和研究生均毕业于首都师范大学中文系。沈老师今年将在我校教授4年级华裔办中文。沈老师热爱教育，有爱心，经验丰富。我们相信她一定能够在中文学校受到同学和家长们的欢迎。</li>

                            <li><b>林怡玲老师. </b>林老师目前在厦门大学的对外汉语教学专业攻读博士学位。她此前在康州的中学和社区大学从事超过五年的中文教学工作。林老师还是美国大学理事会AP 中文考试的阅卷人。林老师有丰富的教学经验，她的学生既包括华裔也包括非华裔的学生。今年, 林老师将在我校讲教授AP 中文，成人中文，以及高年级非华裔中文班。</li>

                        <p>   除了介绍以上两位新老师，我还希望借此机会现任老师：<b>Michael Patrick</b>老师表示衷心的感谢。Patrick老师去年教的英文阅读班和写作班受到了同学和家长的热烈欢迎和好评。今年，除了继续教授写作课之外，Patrick老师还将教一门新课：SSAT辅导班。Patrick老师持有康州高中英文教师资格证，他还在高中和大学里任教多年。Patrick老师还经常给全国性和地方的媒体撰稿，他的文章曾发表在纽约时报等有影响力的媒体上。他还获得过许多新闻界的奖项。Patrick老师拥有新闻传媒专业学士和硕士学位。</p>

                        <p>请大家和我一起来欢迎我们的新老师，并对我们现任的老师们致以谢意！我们期待在新的学年里和大家渡过又一个愉快，充实的一年！</p>

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Textbook Purchase</b><br>
                            Once you complete registration, please come to the cafeteria located in Engleman Hall B Wing to purchase required textbooks. The cafeteria will be open at 12:30 P.M. Please come early to avoid long lines. Please note, we don’t accept credit card so please remember to bring cash or check.</li>

                        <li><b>Finding Classroom</b><br>
                            A school-wide class list will be posted at the front entrance of Engleman Hall A Wing, and at the registration table as well. Outside each classroom, there will be a name list of the students who are taking classes in that room. In order to save time and avoid chaos, we suggest you to look up classroom on our website before come to school. </li>
                    </ol> 
                    <p>In addition, I would also like to draw your attention on the<b> parking situation</b>. The main parking lot in front of the Engleman Hall now has extremely limited spaces due to construction and other factors. Given that your chance of finding a spot in the main lot is very low, I highly recommend you to park either in Lots 12, 12A, and 12B off Crescent Street near the Lyman Center, or in the free garage on Fitch Street, which is past Pelz Gymnasium on the right. Please see the attached map for the location of the parking lots and garage. It is very important to keep in mind that no matter where you park, DO NOT park in the reserved spaces for the President of the University and any other designated spaces with blue signs. If you park in those spaces, your car will not only be ticketed or towed, but also it will cause unnecessary trouble to our school.</p>

                    <p>Thank you, and I and my colleagues really look forward to seeing you all this Sunday!</p>
                    <p>  Best Regards,<br>

                    <p>您们好!</p>
                    <p>首先代表中文学校全体教师和工作人员，热烈欢迎家长和同学们！我们期待与您们共同渡过一个成功的新学年！在此想提醒大家9月7日，星期天是南康中文学校2014-2015新学年的第一天.所有的中文课都将会在这一天开始上课, 其他各类文化课程将在9月14日开始.为了保证开学第一天的各项工作能够顺利有效地进行,我想在此向大家简要介绍一下相关的重要事宜:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>注册</b>
                            <p>和去年一样,我们将在ENGLEMAN HALL的小餐厅(cafeteria)对面设立注册处.如果您是新成员不熟悉情况,请让正门问讯处的工作人员和志愿者帮助您.</p>
                            <p>
                                <b>--如果</b>您已经将付款清单(Payment Voucher)及支票寄给了我们，您可以跳过这一步。暑假期间有近两百个家庭已提前注册并付款，我们对大家的信任和支持表示衷心的感谢;
                                <br/><b>--如果</b>您已经完成网上注册但还未付学费,请将付款清单(Payment Voucher)事先打印出来,连同支票一起交给负责注册的工作人员;
                                <br/><b>--如果</b>您开设了中文学校帐户但是还未进行网上注册, 请记下您的Family ID 和Student ID, 我们可以为您现场注册;
                                <br /><b>--如果</b>您是新成员还没有开设了中文学校帐户,不必担心, 我们的工作人员将会现场帮助您完成课程的注册.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>购买教科书</b><br>
                            注册完成之后,请移步位于B Wing的小餐厅(cafeteria)购买教科书.我们将于下午12:30 开始售书,请尽量提前以免排队拥挤.由于我们不收信用卡，烦请大家带上现金或支票购书。</li>

                        <li><b>查看教室</b><br>
                            我们在正门及注册处附近的墙上都会张贴全校范围的教室和学生名单.各个教室的门口也会张贴教师和学生名单.尽管如此,考虑到第一天会比较拥挤嘈杂,我们强烈建议您事先在学校的网站上查好教室的编号以避免不必要的麻烦.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>除此之外，还想要提醒大家注意<b>停车的问题</b>。由于施工及其它的外界因素,原来的主停车场只有极少的一部分车位可供我们学校成员使用.因此<b>强烈建议您尽可能地停在Crescent Street 上的Lots 12, 12A, 12B; 或免费使用Fitch Street上的车库（在南康体育馆旁）</b>.详细位置请参见附件中的停车示意图。但是不论您选择哪一个停车场，我们需要反复强调的是:严禁停在已经规划给SCSU大学校长、副校长、以及其它人员的有蓝色标志的车位上.如果占用了这些车位,您不仅仅会被罚款或被拖车，也会给中文学校带来很多不必要的麻烦．我们希望大家能够严格遵守这一规定.</p>

                    <p>最后,感谢大家对南康中文学校长期以来的关注与支持。我和我的同事们期待着在新学年里继续为大家服务!将我们的学校越办越好！</p>

                    <p>致<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;礼！</p>

                <h3 class="text-center"> Upcoming Events at SCCS - 初秋活动预告</h3>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="lead"><strong>  Dear SCCS Members,</strong>
                    <p> Happy first day of autumn! Hope you enjoy this gorgeous autumn weather.</p>
                    <ul> 
                        <p>As our school has been back in session for three weeks now, different activities are in full swing. Here I would like to give you a heads up on some upcoming events and activities at the SCCS in the next couple of weeks: </p>

                        <li><b>  Deadline for dropping class passed.</b> Just a friendly reminder that the class shopping period has passed; therefore, no refund will be issued if you drop a class.  
                        </li>
                        <li><b>  School store open this Sunday.</b> Our school store will be open for the first time this semester on Sunday, September 28. Please share this exciting news with your child so that they can redeem their hard-earned tokens for some nice prizes.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>  “My Summer Footprints” poster session on October 5.</b> Thanks to the wonderful ideas of our parents (especially Ms. Yanbin Liu, the Vice Chair of the Board), we plan to organize a student poster session with the theme of family summer travels. During this past summer, our children's footprints have been left all over the world. Whether it is an adventure to distant lands, or a fun trip to local attractions, we would like to encourage our students to share their stories with their friends at the SCCS. The students who are interested in participating in this event should inform their teachers by this Sunday, September 28. The participants are expected to prepare a poster presentation in Chinese (or at least a hybrid of Chinese and English), and have a discussion and Q/A with their peers and families.</li>

                        The poster session will take place in the Cafeteria in B Wing from 12:45 to 5:00 P.M. on October 5. On the day of event, the presenters should set up their posters before class at 12:45pm. They can present when they are not taking class. The recess time of that day will be rearranged to accommodate the event: the recess between the 2nd and 3rd periods will be extended to 20 minutes (from 3: 00-3: 20 P.M.).

                        This event is the first of a series of educational events we plan to host during the new school year. As an educator, I firmly believe that these informal, hands-on and fun activities will greatly increase students’ interests in learning Chinese and improve their practical language skills. In addition to providing high quality Chinese language education, the SCCS seeks to provide all-around education to our student as well. This effort is not only reflected in the new courses such as reading, writing, and public speaking, but also in educational activities outside of the classroom. 

                        <li><b>  Updates on school website.</b> We recently update our school website by posting two touching essays by Linda Zhang, a SCCS alumna, who taught as “Teach for China” fellow in a rural school in Yunnan Province last year. Please check the following link for more details:
                            <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php">http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php</a>
                            If you have any inspiring stories to share, please contact us. We also would like to encourage parents and teachers to contribute articles, photos, and useful resources to the Community page of our website.   
                        </li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, we can’t stress enough that the SCCS belongs to every student, parent and teacher, not only in ideas, but also by the law. Our school has been benefited tremendously from the collective wisdom and talents of our members. In order to give our children a better education and a more promising future, we call for active participation of our parents in school activities. Please consider to make your contribution by serving on different school Committees or simply by signing up as a volunteer! Please take action now!
                    </p>
                    Thank you for your support!

                    <p> Warm Regards,<br>

                    <p class="lead"><strong>亲爱的南康中文学校全体成员,</strong></p>
                    <p>值此金秋的第一天，先祝大家秋安！</p>

                    <p>中文学校已经开学三周了，我们希望您和您的孩子已经适应了新学期。在这里我想简要预告一下中文学校近期内的一些活动:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>首先，想要提醒大家的是本学期取消课程注册的最后期限已过。如果你取消课程，学校将不再会退还学费.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            学校小卖部开业 (<b>时间：9月28日，地点: B Wing一楼小餐厅</b>) 请老师和家长告知同学们本周日前来小餐厅用他们辛勤学习积攒的点数来换取小奖品。
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <ul>
                                <p><b>学生展示活动: “我的夏日足迹”</b></p>

                                <li>为了提高我们学生的中文学习兴趣和综合能力，中文学校计划在本学年展开一系列的课堂外活动。感谢家长们的建议，尤其是理事会副理事长刘岩斌女士的热心支持，我们即将开展的一个活动是“我的夏日足迹”。相信在刚刚过去的这个暑期，孩子们的足迹留在了这个世界的很多地方。无论是远方的故国，还是现在的家园，我们希望孩子们能和他们在中文学校的朋友们分享那些新鲜的感受和欢颜笑语。</li>

                                <li>活动的内容形式如下: 感兴趣参加的同学们请于本周日（09/28）向各班老师报名，然后准备一个可以摆放的展示板（poster），并且准备在展示时的介绍，讨论和回答问题。学校将从10/05号开始在Cafeteria按年级安排展示。展示日12：45可以开始布置展示。展示日课间休息时间将有所调整，由3：00-3：10延长到3：00-3：20，届时展示学生需要守在自己展板前用中文进行交流。</li>

                                <li>相信很多家长和高年级学生对这个活动模式（poster session）不陌生。中文学校在提供高质量的中文教育之外，力图提供孩子们需要的素质教育。这个努力体现在了课表里新增的阅读写作演讲课程里，也将体现在这些生动有趣的课堂外的活动里。</li><br/>
                            </ul>
                        </li> 
                        <li><b> 学校网页更新:</b> 我们最近在学校网站的“校友”栏内增加了两篇中文学校校友张停云的近作。文章请详见以下链接：
                            <a href="http://www.ynhchineseschool.org/prod_v14/Alumini.php">SCCS Alumini</a>
                            停云去年作为国际公益教育组织“美丽中国”的教师在云南的乡村学校支教一年。我们相信她的感人故事会给许多中文学校的同学们带来很多思考和启示。如果您愿意分享类似的有教育意义的校友事迹，请随时同我们联系。
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>最后，我们想再一次强调中文学校属于每一位同学，老师和家长，不仅仅在理念上，也在法律上。为了孩子们更好的教育和成长，中文学校欢迎和期待每一位会员的热心参与和支持。您可以选择参加学校的各种事务委员会或者以一名志愿者的方式来参与。我们真诚的希望大家能够从我做起！从今天开始！
                        <br><br>
                        再次感谢大家对中文学校的信任与支持!</p>

                        <p>大家好！</p>
                        <p>谢谢大家一直以来对中文学校的支持与关怀，也非常钦佩大家为弘扬中国文化所做出的努力和贡献。尤其对那些为如何办好我们的学校和如何提高教学献计献策的有智之士，更加感激。再次衷心谢谢大家！</p>
                        <p>学习和吸取知识是通过广角，多媒体，多渠道，多形式等等的综合体。在我们中文学校，如何激发学生学习中文的兴趣是我们教学的主要宗旨之一。目前我们除了传统的课堂授学，也曾经成功地举办过<b> “南康夏令营”，“我的夏日足迹”，“学生优秀作文/作业展览” </b>，以及 <b> “南康春晚” </b>等活动以引导和激发学生学习中文的兴趣。今后我们也希望创造条件举办一些更直观，更趣味，更娱乐的活动以挖掘学生学习中文的潜能。比如“南康好声音”，“南康好诗词”等等。这些活动还正在酝酿中，计划下学期开始逐步实施。</p>
                        <p>目前我们正在积极准备在本学期的最后一天举办一个名为 <b>“欢歌诗语”</b> 的学生才艺表演活动，主要内容包括：<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li> 演唱中文歌曲 </li>
                            <li> 朗诵中文诗词 </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>形式</b>：南康中文学校在校学生以个人或小组的方式自由报名参加，由评委当场评选出优胜者各两名（歌曲组2名；诗词组2名），被评选出的四位优胜者可直接在今年的“南康春节联欢会”上表演。另外，我们还将为参加活动的同学设立鼓励奖。
                            <br />
                            <b>举办时间</b>：12月14日下午12：30- 1：40 （当天的所有课程顺延20分钟）<br />
                            <b>举办地点</b>：Engleman Hall C112 (小礼堂) <br />

                <h3 class="text-center">Fall 2014 End-of-Semester Announcement - 南康中文学校2014秋季期末通知</h3>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <p class="lead">Dear SCCS Students, Teachers, and Parents,</p>

                        <p>Another exciting semester has flown by. This Sunday, December 14, is the last day of school for the fall 2014 semester. We hope that you and your child have had a wonderful experience at our school. We are grateful for the opportunity to serve your child.</p>

                        <p>To ensure everything running smoothly on the last day of school, I would like to draw you attention on a few important things:</p>

                        <p><b>§  First,</b> the School is organizing an end-of-semester talent show from 12:30 to 1:40 P.M. in Room C112 to celebrate the achievement of our students. In order to accommodate this event, all classes will start 20 min later than the regular class schedule. As a result, the whole class period will run from 1:40 to 5:10 P.M. instead of 1:20 to 4:50 P.M. this Sunday. More details about the talent show will be sent out shortly by the PTA.</p>

                        <p><b>§  Second,</b> please remember to return the teaching evaluation forms to the school office located in Room A105. If, for some reason, you haven’t received the evaluation form, please download the attached electronic copy. Your feedback and suggestions are crucial to improve our teaching quality. We would greatly appreciate if you can take a couple of minutes to complete the form.</p>

                        <p><b>§  The school store will be open this Sunday.</b> Please remind your child to come to the cafeteria to redeem prizes. Please note that there is an important change of policy: gift cards are no longer available at the store. Students must come to the office to redeem gift cards. Students can get gift cards throughout the semester whenever the office is open. Please inform your child about this important change.</p>

                        <p><b>§  Last but not least,</b> a quick reminder that the spring 2015 semester will start on Sunday, January 18 (Chinese classes start on that day and enrichment classes start one week later). All school dates can be found in “School Calendar” on our website. If you haven’t registered for the spring semester, please contact our IT managers at: <a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org">support@ynhchineseschool.org</a> They will help you register classes or make adjustment.</p>

                        <p>Once again, thank you very much for such a wonderful semester at the SCCS. My colleagues and I really enjoyed working with you all. It is truly rewarding.</p>

                        <p>Best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a New Year filled with Peace and Happiness!</p>

                        <p>Cordially,</p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                   
                        <p class="lead"> 尊敬的南康中文学校学生，家长和老师：</p>
                        <p>你们好！</p>

                        <p>时光飞逝，转眼之间难忘的2014年就要结束了。我谨代表中文学校全体老师和工作人员感谢大家在过去的一年里对中文学校的大力支持。我希望您和您的孩子在中文学校渡过了愉快，有意义的一年。

                        <p>这个周日（12月14日）是中文学校在2014年的最后一天，在此有几件重要的事情需要提醒大家：

                        <p><b>§  首先，</b>中文学校将于下午12点半至1点40分在C112小礼堂举办名为“欢歌诗语”的学生才艺表演。为了鼓励各年级的同学们的积极参与，学校特意将这个星期的所有课程顺延20分钟。第一节课将于1点40分开始上课，最后一节课将于5点10分下课。学校PTA稍后将会发出关于才艺表演的详细信息。
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>§  其次，</b>请各位家长将上周发给您的孩子的教学评估表于本周日交到A105 房间学校办公室。如果您尚未收到评估表，请下载附件中的表格。您的反馈和建议将会极大地帮助我们提高教学质量。
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>§  此外，</b>本周学校小卖部开门，请老师和家长提醒同学们兑换奖品。近期学校关于兑换礼品券(gift cards)的规定作出重要调整。从本周开始，小卖部将不再兑换礼品券，所有需要兑换礼品券的同学们请到学校办公室办理。今后，同学们可以每个星期来办公室兑换礼品券，而不必像从前那样必须等到小卖部开门。请家长和老师及时告知同学们这一重要的变化。
                        </p>
                        <p><b>§  最后还需要提醒大家的是，</b>下学期将于1月18号开学（中文课当日上课，文化课一周后上课）。春季的所有上课时间均已列在学校网站的“校历”上，请留意察看。对于需要注册或调整春季课程的家长，请于寒假期间与学校的IT 人员联系：<a href="mailto:support@ynhchineseschool.org">support@ynhchineseschool.org</a>
                        </p>  
                        <p>最后，再一次感谢您的信任与支持！祝您和家人新年快乐，健康幸福！</p>
