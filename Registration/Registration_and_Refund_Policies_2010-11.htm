SCCS Registration Policies (2010-2011)

<LI> Due to large number of classrooms needed, the Chinese language classes will be staggered this year: 
 <ul>
 <li>Grade 1-3 students will have their classes from 1:20pm to 3:00pm, and 
 <li>Grade 4-10 will have theirs from 3:10pm to 4:50pm. 
 <li>Accordingly, some Non-Chinese Classes will start at 1:20pm or 2:15pm. 
 <li>The period is displayed with each class, please check the time carefully when you do enrollment for your kids!
 </ul>
<LI> This year, school will group students based upon student needs. Parents can request, but it is the school that makes the decision. Please don not interrupt the school teaching plan by moving your kids around without any notice to the school!
<LI> Enrichment programs are registered annually or for both the Fall and Spring terms: 
 <ul>
 <li>If you pick the Fall programs but not the Spring programs, the same programs in Spring as in Fall will be automatically added. <li>You can pick different programs in Fall and Spring. 
 <li>If you decide to drop classes, you should request cancellation and refund by contacting support@ynhchineseschool.org or by visiting school office.
