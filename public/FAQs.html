                                    <p>Southern Connecticut Chinese School (SCCS) is one of the oldest and largest community based Chinese language and culture schools in Southern Connecticut region. Located in historic town of New Haven, our school is a non-profit organization (formally 501(c)(3) registered) managed by the parents, owned by all members. Our goal is to promote Chinese language and culture and serve the diverse needs of our community members.</p>

                                    <p class="lead"> What is the mission of our school?</p>
                                    <p>Our school operates according to the school bylaw. The mission of the School is to teach Chinese language, traditional Chinese arts, and to elevate the awareness of Chinese culture in the community. The School admits students, conducts all educational programs and activities without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, marital status, ancestry or disabilities. The school conducts all educational programs and activities only on a non-profit, non- religious, and non-political basis.</p>

                                    <p class="lead">What are the main programs of our school?</p>
                                    <p>While our school was established with classes of heritage Chinese students, we added non-heritage classes later on to meet the growing needs of students with less Chinese background. Now we can provide more comprehensive Chinese education service to our community. With many years of experiences, our school has formed a system of non-heritage Chinese education. Enrichment classes in our school have also been an important part of enriching our students’ campus life. We currently offer a variety of enrichment classes including Chinese Dance, Calligraphy, Kung Fu, Chess, Math, etc. </p>

                                    <p class="lead">Who are the owners of our school?</p>
                                    <p>Our school is an independent educational institution owned by all SCCS members; therefore, the school does not have any shares, neither does it have a Board holding any shares. Nobody may get profit from the school surplus. Every penny earned by the school eventually shall benefit the school itself. We have a Board without holding any shares. It is formed by volunteering parents, elected from and by the school members. No one can automatically get into the Board without going through the parent voting process. The school Board reports to the general member council of all the members. In essence, our members are the owners and decision-makers of the school.</p>

                                    <p class="lead">What are the rights of the members? How can members get involved in school activities?</p>
                                    <p>After you register your child(ren) into the school and pay the membership fee, you immediately become a member of the school, i.e., one of the school owners. You have all the rights to participate in the school activities, including voting and/or being voted as board directors, sitting in board meetings, auditing school finance, organizing the Spring Festival Gala, and going to the summer picnic etc. Hope more parents to get involved into the activities of our own school.</p>

                                    <p>我校是南康州地区最大和最具影响力的中文教学和中国文化传播的社区学校之一。我们学校位于康州历史文化名城纽黑文。我校是由家长管理、由全体现任会员拥有、为孩子们提供成长环境的非盈利教育机构（501(c)(3)正式注册机构）并在中文和文化教育方面面向社区服务。</p>

                                    <p class="lead">南康中文学校的办校宗旨是什么？</p>
                                    <p>我校按照章程行事，以志愿者为基础，以家长们的意愿为导向，以教师们的智慧为依托，向孩子们教授中文和中国文化。最终希望孩子们在他们以后的人生中有更宽广的选择。</p>

                                    <p class="lead">南康中文学校的主要课程设置是什么？</p>
                                    <p>我校早期主要针对中文为母语的华裔学生教授中文，但随后需求的不断增长，我们也系统地开设了面向母语不是中文的学生的非华裔中文班。华裔和非华裔班的开设使得我校能够更全面地向社区提供中文服务。几年的经验积累使我校形成了一套系统性中文教育的整体规划。与此同时，文化课的开设也一直是我校丰富学生校园生活的重要组成部分。我们应家长和同学们的要求还开设了民族舞蹈，武术，书法，数学等课程。</p>

                                    <p class="lead">南康中文学校的所有权归谁？</p>
                                    <p>我们是一所由全体学生家长拥有的独立教育机构，不隶属于任何个人或几个人或其它任何组织。因为我校由全体家长拥有，所以我们学校没有股份，也没有拥有股份的董事会。没有人可以从学校的结余中分红。学校的每一分钱最终都要用于学校本身的事务。我们只设置理事会。理事会成员由家长选出的志愿者组成。没有人可以不经家长选举而自动进入理事会。理事会向全体学生家长负责。学校的运作以会员们的意志为转移，因为会员们才是这所学校的真正主人。</p>

                                    <p>在您把孩子注册入学校并缴纳会费以后，您就成为了本校会员，也就是这所学校的一个拥有者。您有权利参加学校的各种活动，包括选举理事、被选为理事、参加理事会议、审计学校财务、筹组春节联欢会、参与夏季野餐等等。我们希望有更多的家长参与到这所属于您的学校中来。</p>
