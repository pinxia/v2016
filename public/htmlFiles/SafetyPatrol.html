<h3 class="text-center">Safety Patrol Schedule for 2014-2015 School Year</h3>
<h4>Notes to Parents</h4>
<ul>
    <li> You are assigned the school safety patrol duty either from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm or from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm depending on in which period your child is taking the language class. Your additional help is always appreciated if you child is attending enrichment class(es). Please arrive at the Chinese school at 1:00 pm or 3:00 pm on Sunday and report to the Safety Desk at the front door. One of the safety patrol lead will assist you with your duty.</li>
    <li>If you cannot serve the date or time assigned, you should contact support@ynhchineseschool.org in advance to pick another date or time, or you can switch with another family if you can find one who is willing to do so.</li>
    <li>Please read the School Guidelines for Parents on Duty and Fire Emergency Responses to refresh your memory. For the school and our children's safety, please review the document carefully. When you are on duty, make sure to get yourself familiar with the nearest emergency exits. In case of fire emergency or drill, direct and help teachers, students and parents to evacuate the building quickly to a designated safe place (front parking lot, 300 ft away from our building).</li>
    <li>You can use the Find function here or of your browser (Control-F for Windows or Command-F for Mac) to find your name and scheduled date/time, or you can view your patrol schedule after login as parent, My Account -> My Safety Patrol Schedule.</li>
