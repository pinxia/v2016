            <p class="lead"><strong> Dear Members of the SCCS Community,</strong>

            <p>On behalf of the school administrative team, I welcome you back to Southern Connecticut Chinese School for another exciting and rewarding year! This is a friendly reminder that <b> our school will start this Sunday, September 7, 2014.</b> We will have Chinese Language classes this week, but<b> enrichment classes will start next week on September 14.</b> In order to make things run smoothly on the first day of school, I would like to go through a brief “to-do” list:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Class Registration</b><br>
                     <p> As last year, our registration table is located cross hallway from the cafeteria in B Wing. For those of you who are new to our school, please ask our staff at the front entrance of Engleman Hall for direction.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>If</b> you have already mailed payment voucher and check, you can simply skip this step. Almost 200 families have registered and paid during the summer, we would like to express our deep gratitude for your generous support!</li>
                        <li><b>If</b> you have registered classes online but haven’t made the payment, please print out the payment voucher and bring it with the check to the registration table;</li>
                        <li><b>If</b> you have an account but haven’t registered classes, please make sure to get your Family ID and Student ID numbers.  It will make the registration process much easier;</li>
                        <li><b>If</b> you are new to our school and haven’t set up an account, don’t worry, our staff will help you get registered.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Textbook Purchase</b><br>
                        Once you complete registration, please come to the cafeteria located in Engleman Hall B Wing to purchase required textbooks. The cafeteria will be open at 12:30 P.M. Please come early to avoid long lines. Please note, we don’t accept credit card so please remember to bring cash or check.</li>

                <li><b>Finding Classroom</b><br>
                        A school-wide class list will be posted at the front entrance of Engleman Hall A Wing, and at the registration table as well. Outside each classroom, there will be a name list of the students who are taking classes in that room. In order to save time and avoid chaos, we suggest you to look up classroom on our website before come to school. </li>
            </ol> 
            <p>In addition, I would also like to draw your attention on the<b> parking situation</b>. The main parking lot in front of the Engleman Hall now has extremely limited spaces due to construction and other factors. Given that your chance of finding a spot in the main lot is very low, I highly recommend you to park either in Lots 12, 12A, and 12B off Crescent Street near the Lyman Center, or in the free garage on Fitch Street, which is past Pelz Gymnasium on the right. Please see the attached map for the location of the parking lots and garage. It is very important to keep in mind that no matter where you park, DO NOT park in the reserved spaces for the President of the University and any other designated spaces with blue signs. If you park in those spaces, your car will not only be ticketed or towed, but also it will cause unnecessary trouble to our school.</p>

            <p>Thank you, and I and my colleagues really look forward to seeing you all this Sunday!</p>


            <p>  Best Regards,<br>
                Henan Cheng <br>
